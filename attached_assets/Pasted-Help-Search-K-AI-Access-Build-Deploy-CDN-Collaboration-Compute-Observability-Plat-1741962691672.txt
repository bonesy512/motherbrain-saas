Web Analytics
Getting Started
Vercel Web Analytics Quickstart
Vercel Web Analytics provides you detailed insights into your website's visitors. This quickstart guide will help you get started with using Analytics on Vercel.
Select your framework to view instructions on using the Vercel Web Analytics in your project.

To start tracking visitors and page views with Web Analytics, use the following steps:

Enable Web Analytics in Vercel
On the Vercel dashboard, select your Project and then click the Analytics tab and click Enable from the dialog.

Enabling Web Analytics will add new routes (scoped at /_vercel/insights/*) after your next deployment.

Add @vercel/analytics to your project
Using the package manager of your choice, add the @vercel/analytics package to your project:

pnpm
yarn
npm

pnpm i @vercel/analytics
Add the Analytics component to your app
The Analytics component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with Next.js, including route support.

Add the following code to the root layout:

app/layout.tsx
Next.js (/app)

Next.js (/app)
TypeScript

TypeScript

import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Next.js</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
Deploy your app to Vercel
Deploy your app using the following command:

terminal

vercel deploy
If you haven't already, we also recommend connecting your project's Git repository, which will enable Vercel to deploy your latest commits to main without terminal commands.

Once your app is deployed, it will start tracking visitors and page views.

If everything is set up properly, you should be able to see a Fetch/XHR request in your browser's Network tab from /_vercel/insights/view when you visit any page.

View your data in the dashboard
Once your app is deployed, and users have visited your site, you can view your data in the dashboard.

To do so, go to your dashboard, select your project, and click the Analytics tab.

After a few days of visitors, you'll be able to start exploring your data by viewing and filtering the panels.

Users on Pro and Enterprise plans can also add custom events to their data to track user interactions such as button clicks, form submissions, or purchases.
